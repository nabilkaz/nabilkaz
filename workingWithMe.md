# Working with me

## Core values

Core values are the fundamental beliefs and behaviors that guide my decisions and actions as a leader. Understanding these values helps you know what truly drives me and how I'll approach our work together - from daily interactions to long-term strategic decisions.

My core work values are:

- **Curiosity** - Active desire to explore, learn and understand deeply, with a focus on both technical solutions and human needs, driven by asking probing questions
- **Cooperation** - Building psychological safety and inclusive environments that foster collaborative relationships and knowledge sharing across teams
- **Advancement** - Driving collective progress and expanding capabilities through scalable systems that elevate everyone's growth together

## Leadership Philosophy and Style

I am a growth-oriented leader focused on collective learning and development. Motivated by helping teams explore possibilities together while making meaningful progress, I lead through questions rather than directives, seeking to understand deeply while encouraging others to do the same.
